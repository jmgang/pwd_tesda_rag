# TESDA Course Recommender for PWDs and Lesson Generator for TESDA

## Project Overview

This project is designed to assist Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) in finding TESDA courses that align with their interests and accommodate their disabilities.

This includes core competencies, entry requirements, and potential job prospects.
